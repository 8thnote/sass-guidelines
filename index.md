# About the author

My name is [Hugo Giraudel](http://hugogiraudel.com), I am a front-end developer from France about to move in Germany. I have been writing Sass for over two years now and am the author of Sass related projects such as [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com) and [Sass-Compatibility](http://sass-compatibility.github.com).

I have also written a couple of Sass libraries, mostly for the heck of it: [SassyJSON](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/SassyJSON), [SassyLists](https://github.com/at-import/SassyLists), [SassySort](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/SassySort), [SassyCast](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/SassyCast), [SassyMatrix](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/SassyMatrix), [SassyBitwise](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/SassyBitwise), [SassyIteratorsGenerators](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/SassyIteratorsGenerators), [SassyLogger](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/SassyLogger), [SassyStrings](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/SassyStrings) and [SassyGradients](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/SassyGradients).

# Introduction

> Sass is an extension of CSS that adds power and elegance to the basic language.

This is how Sass describes itself in its documentation. Sass ultimate objective is to fix CSS flaws. CSS, as we all know, is not the best language in the world. While very simple to learn, it can quickly get quite messy, especially on large projects.

This is where Sass comes in, as a meta-language, to improve CSS syntax in order to provide extra features and handy tools. Meanwhile, Sass wants to be conservative regarding CSS language.

The point is not to turn CSS into a fully-featured programming language; Sass only wants to help where CSS fails. Because of this, getting started with Sass is not any harder than learning CSS: it simply adds a couple of extra features on top of it.

That being said, there are many ways to use these features. Some good, some bad, so unusual. Those guidelines are meant to give you a consistent and documented approach to writing Sass code.

## The importance of a styleguide

The more actors involved in CSS writing on a project, the more code guidelines are needed. Along the same lines, the bigger the project, the more a styleguide is a must.

## Disclaimer

Those Sass guidelines are my own and somehow very opinionated. Think of it as a collection of tips methodologies and advices I have polished and given over the years.

They are not the only way of doing and may or may not suit your project. Feel free to pick from it and adapt them to your needs. As we say *your mileage may vary*.
