## Sass Guidelines

### How to run

**Sass Guidelines** runs on **Jekyll**, a static website generator. To run your own local version of these guidelines, you'll need to:

1) `git clone` this repository and switch to the `gh-pages` branch by doing `git checkout gh-pages`.

2) Install Jekyll on your machine. The quick and easy way to do this is to run `gem install jekyll`.

3) Once installed, run `jekyll serve` and point your browser to `http://localhost:4000`.
