# Translation notes

The purpose of this file is to define some common guidelines for translations
performed by several people. As you might know, translating anything from one
language to another is usually tricky and subjectivity is commonly present.
It becomes important then to explicitly state common translation agreements for
a particular language, like the best way to translate a certain expression or
which expressions should not be translated at all, for example.
